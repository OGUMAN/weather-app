# The weather website
<p>This website is for seeing the weather of any location: city, village, street, etc. You can watch the weather on the map: wind, temperature, lighting, clouds, pressure, and rain. The stack is Nuxt 3, Pinia, Vue 3, TypeScript, and SCSS. The website is using the service www.windy.com for the map, https://open-meteo.com for weather data, https://locationiq.com for search, and https://worldtimeapi.org for the current local time for a given timezone.</p>
